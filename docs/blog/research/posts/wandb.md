# Planned GraphProcessing Research

## Future Experiment: Optimizing Graph Analysis and Generation

### Research Objective
To evaluate and improve the performance of GraphProcessing algorithms through MIT-led refactoring, with a focus on optimizing graph analysis and generation processes.

### Current Status: Preparation and Integration Phase

We are currently in the process of:

1. Reproducing the existing GraphProcessing algorithms
2. Integrating our experimental setup with monitoring and logging tools:
   - Weights and Biases (wandb)
   - Neptune.ai

## Planned Experiment Details

Once the preparation phase is complete, our research will focus on:

1. Benchmarking current graph generation algorithms
2. Analyzing the efficiency of existing graph analysis techniques
3. Identifying potential areas for optimization in both generation and analysis processes

Key areas of investigation will include:

- Algorithmic efficiency in graph generation
- Speed and accuracy of graph analysis methods
- Scalability of current implementations with increasing graph complexity

## Integration of Monitoring Tools

### Weights and Biases (wandb)
- Will be used for experiment tracking and visualization
- Planned metrics include processing time, memory usage, and algorithm-specific performance indicators

### Neptune.ai
- Will serve as our experiment management platform
- Will help in versioning our datasets, models, and code

## Anticipated Outcomes

This research aims to:

1. Establish a robust baseline for current GraphProcessing performance
2. Identify specific areas within the algorithms that would benefit most from optimization
3. Propose potential refactoring strategies based on empirical data

## Future Steps

Following the completion of this preparatory phase, we plan to:

1. Implement proposed optimizations based on our findings
2. Conduct comparative experiments between original and refactored versions
3. Explore the integration of advanced techniques, such as parallelization or machine learning, to further enhance performance

We will update this page with live experimental data and results as they become available. Stay tuned for updates on our progress in advancing GraphProcessing techniques!
